Module 2, Programming Assignment 1, Problem 3

    Prob 2: Iteration Constructs

For this problem print out the numbers 1-5 using several different loop structures.

1. print 1-5 with spaces between the numbers on a single line using a for loop
2. print 1-5 with spaces between the numbers on a single line using a while loop
3. print 1-5 with spaces between the numbers on a single line using a do/while loop
HINT: use Write() instead of WriteLine() in the loop body. Follow the loop with a 
WriteLine() call to insert the newline character at the end of the sequence.
